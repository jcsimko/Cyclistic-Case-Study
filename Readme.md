## Overview
This is a capstone project as a part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate course offered by [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics). I am analyzing the usage patterns of Cyclistic, a fictitious bike-sharing company in Chicago, to identify differences between casual riders and annual members. My goal is to help the marketing team devise strategies to convert casual riders into annual members, ultimately driving company growth. I will follow a structured approach using Google’s data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act. By examining historical trip data over the past 12 months, I aim to answer key business questions, uncover trends, and provide actionable insights backed by compelling data visualizations. The resulting analysis and recommendations will be presented to the executive team to inform marketing strategies aimed at increasing the number of annual members. 

## About the Data
I used Cyclistic’s historical trip data to analyze and identify trends from [here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html). The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this [license](https://www.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement). There is a separate csv file for each month of data. I downloaded the previous 12 months (May 2022 through April 2023) of Cyclistic trip data.

## Tools
The tools I used for this project were RStudio (RStudio 2023.03.1 Build 446) running R (version 4.3.0) and Microsoft Excel (Office 365 version) running under Windows 11 (Home) operating system.
